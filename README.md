# Corak: Identify Batik Motives with Your Phone

## Definition

Corak is an **_AI-powered_** mobile app that created to identify Batik motives using smartphone camera.

#

## Summary

One of the national character developments is the preservation of culture as a national identity. Preserving can be started from knowing and understanding.

Batik, is Indonesian culture which in this modern era is less recognized by children. What makes children less familiar with batik? How well technology supported batik information in Indonesia’s learning system?

We choose to take this problem, a combination of cultural introduction with technology. With “Corak” knowing the motive, type, area of origin, and other information is as easy as turning on the camera, pointing it, and let the “Corak” tell you the details.
